title: Monday lab canceled next week
---

Labs, office hours, and discussion sections will begin Week 2.
Next week, because of Labor Day, a make-up lab section will be held Wednesday (9/4) 6-9pm for the Monday lab section. For the first lab, if you are enrolled in the Monday section but cannot attend the make-up section, you can attend another lab section next week provided you send the TAs leading the section an email asking for permission beforehand.
