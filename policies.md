## About the Course

This course is an introduction to the field of robotics. It covers the fundamentals of kinematics, dynamics, and control of robot manipulators, robotic vision, and sensing. The course deals with forward and inverse kinematics of serial chain manipulators, the manipulator Jacobian, force relations, dynamics, and control. It presents elementary principles on proximity, tactile, and force sensing, vision sensors, camera calibration, stereo construction, and motion detection. The course concludes with current applications of robotics in active perception, medical robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other areas. Students are expected to have a background in linear algebra, calculus, and basic physics, as well as familiarity with the Python programming language. The lectures are supplemented with homeworks and experimental work in the laboratory using several Baxter, Sawyer, and TurtleBot robots. There are two midterms, but no final exam. The last month of the course is devoted to the design and implementation of a final project, carried out individually or in groups of 2-4 students. All questions can and should be directed to **Piazza** for the fastest response.

## Resources

The required text is Richard Murray, Zexiang Li and S. Shankar Sastry’s A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation (first edition digitally available <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/mlswiki/?title=First_edition">here</a>). Additional lectures will cover the basics of computer vision, path planning, state estimation, and control.


## Homeworks

Homeworks will be collected and graded using the Gradescope system. Create an account on gradescope.com with your Berkeley email account and SID. Add this course with the code **CODE**.

There will be a total of 7 homeworks, due weekly through mid-November. Each student is allocated 5 total days of extension, to be used on any homework assignment with no loss of points. To allow for homework solutions to be released in a timely manner, no more than 2 extension days may be used on a single assignment. After the extension days have elapsed, homeworks will be accepted for a geometrically decreasing number of points (i.e., 1 day late -> half credit, 2 days late -> quarter credit, . . . , N days late -> 1=2N credit).
Collaboration on homework sets is encouraged, but all students must write up their own solution set. Additionally, every student is accountable for the solutions they submit and may be asked to discuss them with a GSI or instructor. **Please list all collaborators at the top of each submitted homework set.**

## Midterms

There will be two midterms covering the course material, on September 27 and November 8. Each midterm will be 80 minutes and will occur during lecture. If you have an anticipated conflict with one of the midterm dates, please notify the GSIs by email before the end of the second week of the term.

## Labs

Mandatory lab sections will meet each week beginning the first full week of classes and will run through the week of October 30. Please ensure that you have been assigned a lab section that you are regularly able to attend, as we rely on an even distribution of students so that everyone has access to hardware. In lieu of formal reports, labs are completed by discussing your system with and demonstrating its functionality to your lab GSI during various “check-offs” specified in each lab description. **Note that all students who are being checked off must be present at the time of the check-off, in the interest of making sure everyone can fully explain the code and system functionality. In the event that you cannot attend your scheduled lab section one week, please inform your lab’s head GSI before the meeting of the lab and we will do our best to accommodate you in a different lab section for the week.** Note that we cannot promise to accommodate after-the-fact requests to attend a different section. 

Labs should ideally be completed by the end of your assigned lab section, and are scoped such that this should be feasible. We recognize, however, that due to different levels of previous experience with the material — as well as the challenges of working with real hardware — this will not always be possible. In order to accommodate this variation while ensuring that students do not fall behind, we have developed the following (admittedly complex) policies:

- Labs 1-2 are a serial introduction to ROS and the other tools used in this class. They must therefore be completed by the start* of your assigned lab section the following week.
- Labs 3-8 occur in blocks of two labs each (3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8); each block is dependent on the previous block, but labs within each block are not dependent on each other and may be completed in any order. Both labs from each block must be completed by the *start* of your first assigned lab section for the following block.

*The start of your lab section is a hard cutoff — that is, if an assignment is due at the start of lab section, you may not check off that assignment at the start of class for full credit; it must be checked off beforehand. This policy is in place because many of the labs fully fill the allotted time, and we want to keep everyone on schedule.*

If labs are not completed and checked off by the times above, they may be checked off for half credit for one week following the deadline, after which no credit will be given. Labs may be worked on outside of class hours as long as proper safety policies are followed (namely, you have been instructed in the correct policies and etiquette for the hardware you are using, and if you are using hardware, two or more people are present in the lab). Labs may be checked off at lab TAs' office hours or you may request to attend a different lab section for the check-off by asking a GSI. Note that many of the labs in this class are full, and you will not be allowed to attend them.

## Final Project

The final project will constitute the largest single portion of your grade for this course and must include sensing, planning, and actuation components on real hardware. Project deliverables include a proposal, a video, a live demo, a final report, and several intermediate check-ins. Further information will be forthcoming; in the meantime, feel free to explore the list of previous projects available on bCourses!
Due to the types of deliverables involved (e.g., live demonstrations), slack days may not be used on project deliverables, and late work will not be accepted.

## Office Hours

The instructors will hold weekly office hours to discuss lecture content, homework assignments, projects, and other course material. We will try our best to schedule them so that each student has the opportunity to attend at least one office hour each week. When discussing a current homework assignment, instructors will not provide solutions. Rather, instructors will be happy to help clarify fundamentals and to guide students’ reasoning in related problems.

## Regrade Requests

If you feel that your work has been graded unfairly, you may request a regrade by submitting a request on Gradescope with a written statement explaining the mistake. Be aware that points may be deducted as well as added if a regrade is requested.

## Advice 

The following tips are offered based on our experience.

**Do the homeworks!** The homeworks are explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. Although the numerical weight of the homeworks is not huge, there is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and final grades in the class.

**Keep up with lectures!** Discussion sections, labs and homeworks all touch on portions of what we discuss in lecture. Students do much better if they stay on track with the course. That will also help you keep the pace with your homework and study group.

**Take part in discussion sections!** Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to benefit from it.

**Come to office hours!** We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the material better.

**Form study groups!** As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. Also recall the caveat above, that you must write up your solutions on your own. We strongly advise you to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get you in practice for the exams. Make sure you work through all problems yourself, and that your final write-up is your own. Some groups try to split up the problems ("you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap notes"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a lot less from this course.
